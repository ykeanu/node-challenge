# Node Challenge
I was challenged to print daily account balances based on the transaction history of a user. In this case, I was provided with a transaction history between the date range of "2018-02-02" and "2017-11-09", which totaled 85 days (not including start day). There could either by multiple or zero transactions occuring on a single day.

### Input
- Current Balance (Integer)
- Transaction History (Array of Objects

### Output
- Print out end-of-day account balance for every previous day. 
- Each console.log must have: (1) Date (2) Account Balance.
